# Distance and Pose Estimation with Dual Proximity Sensors & Trailer Model
Project Overview
This project simulates an autonomous sprayer equipped with two proximity sensors mounted on a wheel. The goal is to estimate the distance traveled and the pose (position and orientation) of the sprayer over time. The simulation incorporates a trailer model to account for pose estimation errors during turns. A Kalman Filter is used to fuse the sensor data and reduce noise for accurate estimation.
